The project is build based on Udemy Course: Complete React Developer in 2022 (w/ Redux, Hooks, GraphQL) by Andrei Neagoie.

The app is build using ReactJs for fron-end and Firestore for back-end. 

Main take-away from the project: 
- Using components wisely for a big project
- Styling components
- Using states ( useState, useEffect, useContext, useNavigate)
- Using React Router Dom
- Adding functionality to online store like add-to-cart, check-out button
- Using Firebase for authentication by Gmail, sign-up form and allowing user to sign up after that.

P.S: 
- Special thanks to instructors of the course (Andrei and Yihua) and Netlify for free deployment
- The app is still under progress for better functionalities.
